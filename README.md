Stuff to do:

Lets fix ui stuff first real quick,
then do the backend for login.
Then integrate




Make a chess vid since its prob not gonna work,           

Then lastly we work on the python integration if not just make a vid much easier.

Some stuff noticed to fix eventually later for smooth user exp:

pfp change on change should change the top right on header,
if refresh page on pfp message should be gone
can prob remove the email being displayed on the dropdown
Bug when starting need to double click and wait for fast refresh.
Add the missing links ex: academics end, terms and privacy etc.
Will have to change the way the image saving is handled Ill need to store it in the db or cloud.


So the plan for prio now:


Video for Chess-> later we can change.

Fast API coding and linkage with ai model, into docker, into next js linkage...

Then fix site, Then deploy, then bug fix.

Will have to add this https://developers.google.com/terms#a_your_end_users

REMINDER TO FIX DB COLLECTIONS FOR DELETED STUFF
